## react-native-drawer-layout

A platform-agnostic drawer layout. Pure JavaScript implementation on iOS and native implementation on Android. Why? Because the drawer layout is a useful component regardless of the platform! And if you can use it without changing any code, that's perfect.

## Add it to your project

1. Run `npm install react-native-drawer-layout --save`
1. var DrawerLayout = require('react-native-drawer-layout');
